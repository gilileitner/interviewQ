# interviewQ
You are required to write an application that would read students courses and grades data from a text file. Each record is in a separate line in the format
StudentId,Student Name,Course Name,Grade


The application should print for each student:
* Average grade.
* Names of all the courses the student had, sorted by ABC order.
If a student had more than one grade for the same course, print the student name followed by an error message.

You can assume input format validity in terms of delimiter, number of records, order of records, content of records etcâ€™.

Your entry point for implementation is the method:
void printStudents(List<String>  lines) {
}

You can test your code by running StudentPrinterTest



Sample input:

```
1,Erez,Math,85

3,Ronen,English,80
2,Netanel,English,75
1,Erez,Math,65
```
Sample output:
```
1,Erez,ERROR
2,Netanel,82.5,Math,English
3,Ronen,80,English
```
